This is a loader ripped from the game Street Gang (as far as I can remember) which I ripped and relocated manually. 

1. it needs to be relocated to $cc00 (I don't know why its loading to $5000)

2. init (load the irq loader to disk RAM) jsr $cc00

3. load by calling 

ldy #$ petscii filename char 1
ldx #$ petscii filename char 2
lda #$ hi byte of load address
sta $2f
lda #$ lo byte of load address
sta $2e
jsr $cf00 

This is a blocking call, however it allows IRQ to continue running.
