# EXAMPLE DATA

## training.data.tar.gz
This file is the output of the `convert.py` program after processing the 1.3 million images from the Google Quick! Draw! library we have selected (see the project README)

## data.asm
This is the output of the `train.py` program after processing 5 training passes of the training.data file. It took my 4Ghz machine about 7 hours to complete, so you probably want to use this file unless you're changing something.
