# pyTinn
Pythonic port of the [Tinn library](https://github.com/glouw/tinn) in 100 lines of code.

For a quick demo, get some training data:

    wget http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/semeion/semeion.data

Run:

    python test.py

NOTE: this is originally from https://github.com/nvalis/pyTinn

Adapted by J.Cincotta for rendering fixed point output and using a sampled activation function to train an neural network that can be forward propagated on a 6502 efficiently.
